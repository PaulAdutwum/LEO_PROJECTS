# ArrayList Implementation in Python

This project implements a custom `ArrayList` data structure in Python, designed to simulate how dynamic arrays work under the hood. Unlike standard Python lists, this array is built from scratch to help understand memory allocation, resizing mechanisms, and element shifting.

## üîç Features

- Dynamic resizing when capacity is exceeded
- Add elements to the end (`add`)
- Insert elements at any valid index (`insert`)
- Retrieve elements by index (`get`)
- Remove elements by index (`remove`)
- Check current size (`size`)
- Check if the list is empty (`isEmpty`)
- Clean string representation of the list (`__str__`)

## Objectives

- Understand how dynamic arrays are implemented
- Practice low-level data structure design
- Develop problem-solving and debugging skills
- Handle memory management concepts manually
